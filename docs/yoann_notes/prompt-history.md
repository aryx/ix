# Prompt history

Every prompt Yoann wrote to Claude to build this repository, in order,
verbatim (typos included), each followed by a short summary of Claude's
answer. The summaries are written by a small model (Haiku) from the
answer's text: they are paraphrases, not records, and the commits show
what was actually done. Together with `git log`, this file tells how ix
came to be.

Entries are appended by Claude Code hooks (`.claude/hooks/history.py`,
set in `.claude/settings.json`), so only sessions started in this
repository are recorded. The first entries, from a session started in
ocaml-elm-playground before this repository existed, were rebuilt from
that session's transcript. Times are UTC.

**Claude (summary):**

Claude recommended keeping TinyOS in this repo under os/ to defer the repository split decision.
Claude noted the emulator could reuse the Playground's screen, keyboard, and clock as a native or web app.
Claude explained golden frame tests would work as boot tests without requiring new tooling.
Claude identified that splitting makes sense only if TinyOS gets its own site, uses non-OCaml, or performance suffers.
Claude sketched layout rules that keep os/ self-contained and splittable via git filter-repo without future restructuring.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Yoann:**

> but in a separate repo it could still use the playground via opam. regarding the language, it's ok to code those new TinyXxx (kernel, assembler, linker, etc.) in OCaml as the goal is teaching and OCaml is a great implementation language. In fact in Xix I wrote a compiler for C using OCaml, and that is fine. for the kernel we could also write it in OCaml but that will be a bit challenging but we can make it work I think

**Claude (summary):**

Claude revised the recommendation to start with TinyOS in the existing repository's `os/` directory. Claude noted that graphics libraries and test utilities would need to become public APIs if extracting to a separate repo. Claude described the Nachos architecture where an OCaml kernel runs on the host and user programs run on the emulated CPU. Claude recommended deferring the repository split until the Playground API stabilizes to reduce friction. Claude identified the instruction set architecture choice as a key early decision to make.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 08:18

**Yoann:**

> one issue is that The elements of computing system does something similar, but it goes to minimal with a really toy arch, really toy assembler, toy OS. Here I want Tiny but not Toy. I could imagine to use a subset of ARM for the machine/emulator; for instance the ARM condition or shift register are nice but complicate things; ideally we would do an emulator for a subset of ARM but it would actually work on real ARM binaries (provided the linker in xix is slightly modified to generate only the ARM subset we chose; not too hard to do).

**Claude (summary):**

Claude noted that xix already has kernel and machine directories, making it the full-size twin of the series.
Claude recommended restricting to real binaries that run on actual ARM systems via the Plan 9 syscall ABI.
Claude proposed an ARMv5 subset keeping common instructions but dropping LDM/STM, long multiplies, and coprocessor instructions entirely.
Claude identified that linker changes alone were insufficient; 5c's code generator and libc hand-written assembly also need modification.
Claude suggested an instruction-form histogram over 5c's output to decide the subset with data rather than guesses.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 08:22

**Yoann:**

> one argument pro separate repo is that the tiny assembler, linker, should not depend on anything graphics/ audio/ etc. they must be terminal programs operating on files and using stdin and stout.

**Claude (summary):**

Claude recommended a separate repository, arguing monorepos can't cleanly separate terminal tools from graphics and audio dependencies.
Claude proposed a tinyxxx/ layout with lib/, assembler/, linker/, compiler/, kernel/, emulator/, and emulator_gui/ directories.
Claude identified that monorepos force unnecessary dependency installation and can't enforce the xix-style Cap system conventions.
Claude noted TinyOS was already a Berkeley sensor network operating system that would dominate search results.
Claude offered to write a plan document covering repository layout, ARM subset, and differential testing strategy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 08:22

**Yoann:**

> only really the emulator would depend on the playground for displaying the machine

**Claude (summary):**

Claude agreed only the emulator_gui package would need the elm_playground dependency.
Claude recommended keeping the CPU, memory, and devices as a pure library without graphics.
Claude suggested making the Playground front-end a thin game that runs CPU steps per frame.
Claude identified one needed change: a public pixel buffer drawing API on elm_playground's next.
Claude mentioned an alternative architecture to invert the dependency and place the display app here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 08:25

**Yoann:**

> maybe we could create a tiny-xix since tiny-os is already taken.

**Claude (summary):**

Claude recommended `tiny-xix` as the project name, arguing it better signals the twin relationship than generic alternatives.
Claude explained it states the pairing with xix, fits the ARM subset plan, and ensures unambiguous naming.
Claude noted readers might not know xix but suggested adding a README subtitle to address that concern.
Claude specified naming conventions: opam package `tiny_xix`, programs named `TinyXxx` matching the paired relationship with xix.
Claude saved project decisions to memory and recommended measuring the instruction histogram as the first concrete step.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 08:28

**Yoann:**

> any other possible names instead of tiny-xix?

**Claude (summary):**

Claude organized naming alternatives by theme: xix, principia-softwarica, Plan 9 heritage, or descriptive naming approaches.
Claude recommended checking GitHub and opam registries for naming collisions before committing to a choice.
Claude ranked them as tiny-xix clearest, principia-minima most memorable, ocaml-tiny-computer best for unfamiliar readers.
Claude flagged that ix was used by Nemo for a system and tiny-computer likely already exists.
Claude clarified that individual programs would keep their TinyXxx names regardless of the project name.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 08:52

**Yoann:**

> I like a lot ix and that it's both a Plan 9 reference and a xix reference

**Claude (summary):**

Claude updated the naming notes, setting "ix" as the preferred project name and "tiny-xix" as fallback.
Claude provided supporting sources referencing Plan 9 and the Nix project by Fran. J. Ballesteros.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 08:53

**Yoann:**

> also ix is like the xix project, but shorter (tiny) and ix is shorter than xix :)

**Claude (summary):**

Claude explained that ix works as xix made smaller with fewer letters and lines of code.
Claude noted that as roman numerals, xix is nineteen while ix is nine, the smaller number.
Claude observed that -ix is the suffix of Unix systems like Minix, Xenix, and Linux.
Claude highlighted that keeping only the suffix describes Tiny, not Toy philosophy perfectly.
Claude proposed a one-line README description combining all the naming insights together.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 08:53

**Yoann:**

> also you found the name, and the code in ix will be all yours mostly (with my direction), while xix is mostly my code

**Claude (summary):**

Claude acknowledged suggesting the name "ix" but credited Yoann for seeing its real potential. Claude recommended documenting the split in README as xix versus ix: full-size versus tiny. Claude explained this creates a fair comparison of the same system written at different scales. Claude advised using "Claude Code" authorship with Yoann's copyright for nearly all ix files. Claude suggested dropping or selectively keeping claude: comment tags in ix since it's mostly AI-written.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 09:01

**Yoann:**

> also ix will use ai, so I like this 2 letters constraint, also unix/plan9 people loved 2 letters acronyms

**Claude (summary):**

Claude confirmed two-letter names follow Unix/Plan 9 convention like ls, cp, ed, and xix's tools.
Claude suggested ix programs get two-letter names while source files keep TinyXxx names for consistency.
Claude warned that as, ld, cc in PATH would shadow GNU host tools if unqualified.
Claude proposed using letter-plus-digit names like ia, il, ic, ie to avoid shadowing while staying recognizable.
Claude noted this naming detail can be deferred to the first repository commit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 09:13

**Yoann:**

> I've created a github repo for it, and it's accessible under ~/ix  Let's populate the README.md and add a docs/history.md that explain how this project came to be, with some of the discussions above, how the name was chosen, relation to principia and xix, the fact that you found the name (and you can also recall the history that was a negative proposition at first). here no need for docs/claude_notes/ because the whole repo will be claude stuff

**Claude (summary):**

Claude filled README.md with "xix, but tiny" tagline, covering Nand2Tetris differences, design architecture, planned programs, and project relationships.
Claude wrote docs/history.md documenting how decisions emerged from conversation, including how ix was chosen when TinyOS was taken.
Claude quoted Yoann directly throughout history, capturing discussions on repository location, ARM subset design, OCaml kernel, and authorship details.
Claude noted quotes used informal wording needing possible rephrasing and withheld the license choice pending Yoann's preference.
Claude left both files uncommitted for review and updated saved notes confirming ~/ix exists with ix as the final name.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 09:14

**Yoann:**

> use the same license as xix and commit

**Claude (summary):**

Claude committed license and copyright files to ~/ix as commit 9a04cc6 on main.
Claude created license.txt as exact copy of xix's LGPL 2.1 license with linking exception.
Claude wrote copyright.txt following xix's format, attributing to Yoann Padioleau and Claude Code.
Claude updated README.md to include a License section pointing to both license files.
Claude asked Yoann to review the changes before pushing to the remote repository.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 09:18

**Yoann:**

> for the README, it will be more than an emulator and a kernel. It will cover all the principia books programs

**Claude (summary):**

Claude replaced the README's emulator-and-kernel framing with full Principia Softwarica system coverage.
The new tagline is "the whole Principia Softwarica system, from the machine to the web browser".
Claude created a series table with one row per book, showing ix programs and Plan 9 originals.
Claude updated docs/history.md to note that you widened scope to every book's programs.
The graphics stack, windowing system, and web browser now run on the machine drawing into framebuffer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 09:19

**Yoann:**

> also when you mention xix, probably need to put the website url of its website

**Claude (summary):**

Claude added https://aryx.github.io/xix/ links to README and docs/history.md at first mentions. Links appear throughout tagline, Design, Relation sections in README and across history.md sections. Claude deliberately omitted links from duplicate mentions in same paragraphs and preserved direct quotes. Changes expanded documentation scope by strategically placing website links without redundant duplication. Claude left the changes uncommitted and asked whether Yoann wanted them committed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 09:23

**Yoann:**

> ideally we could also save the whole set of prompts that generate this repo! each time I write something, you could save it under docs/yoann_notes/prompt-history.md ! with the date maybe, so with this and the commit date one can reconstruct how this repository cam e to be, and we can start with the prompt in this whole session (and maybe your corresponding response in answers-history.md or something, or maybe inserted in prompt-history.md itself

**Claude (summary):**

(no answer: the request errored out)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 09:23

**Yoann:**

> hmm you generated an error, so maybe we can just save my prompts but not your (understerminstic) answers

**Claude (summary):**

Claude set up prompt history in ~/ix containing seventeen user prompts with UTC timestamps.
Claude created docs/yoann_notes/prompt-history.md with exact prompts from transcript, deliberately excluding answers.
Claude set up a hook in .claude/hooks/log_prompt.py to automatically log future prompts.
Claude tested the hook, confirmed it works correctly, and limited it to ~/ix.
Claude left .claude/, docs/yoann_notes/, and README changes uncommitted, asking about splitting commits.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 09:26

**Yoann:**

> any way we could also include a summary of your response in the prompt file?

**Claude (summary):**

Claude recommended a Stop hook that pipes responses to a small model for automatic summaries. The hook reads the transcript after each turn and appends the haiku summary to the prompt. Claude noted it runs in the background with minimal cost and requires running from outside ~/ix. Claude contrasted this with manual summaries or deterministic copying of first sentences. Claude offered to implement option 1 and backfill summaries for the session's seventeen existing prompts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 09:26

**Yoann:**

> so this make the conversation more elligible?

**Claude (summary):**

Claude affirmed that summaries substantially improved readability and made the dialogue more followable.
Claude explained that brief summaries per turn convert half-dialogue into a coherent story.
Claude outlined the trade-off: summaries are paraphrase, marked as such, and must stay short.
Claude added the last two prompts by hand since the hook didn't fire this session.
Claude proposed setting up a Stop hook with Haiku to generate summaries automatically.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 09:28

**Yoann:**

> or would it be possible to get your whole answer each time copied? (without the Update thing that shows files modification though, that would be too big)

**Claude (summary):**

(no answer: the request errored out)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 09:29

**Yoann:**

> ok an error again, so I guess this is not possible. Then let's try your recommended 1st option and we can refine and switch to another one later. Ideally the summary will be 4 or 5 lines

**Claude (summary):**

Claude confirmed that Haiku can work headless without a graphical display server environment.
Claude decided to write a hook script that logs prompts and summarizes each answer.
The script can rebuild the entire summary file from a complete prompt and answer transcript.
Claude chose to use separator lines to keep prompts and answers visually distinct from each other.

## 2026-09-21 09:33

**Yoann:**

> ok what's next?

**Claude (summary):**

Claude continued implementing the hooks/history plan that had been established in previous work.
Claude finished writing `.claude/hooks/history.py` to implement the planned logging functionality.
Claude tightened the summary format and properly handled safeguards errors in the output.
Claude wired the `Stop` hook into the system and rebuilt the session log.
Claude rebuilt the full prompt-history file from the transcript with turn summaries.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 10:05

**Yoann:**

> let's test this prompt automatic saving hook we setup previously

**Claude (summary):**

Claude confirmed the UserPromptSubmit hook had already fired and appended the prompt to docs/yoann_notes/prompt-history.md.
Claude explained the Stop hook runs asynchronously after each response to append a Claude summary block.
Claude noted the prompt-capture side test was already passing based on the appended entry.
Claude recommended checking the file after turn completion since the Stop hook has a 60-second timeout.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 10:08

**Yoann:**

> Check the tail of /home/pad/github/ix/docs/yoann_notes/prompt-history.md to confirm the Stop hook appended a "**Claude (summary):**" block for the "let's test this prompt automatic saving hook" entry, and report the result to the user.

**Claude (summary):**

Claude reported that the UserPromptSubmit hook fired and appended the prompt to prompt-history.md.
Claude explained the Stop hook will run asynchronously and append a summary block after finishing.
Claude confirmed the prompt-capture side of the test was passing successfully so far.
Claude noted the Stop hook runs async with up to sixty-second timeout for the summary.
Claude planned to check the file in about two minutes to verify the summary got appended.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 10:30

**Yoann:**

> let's fix a few things in the README.md. First xv6 was just a kernel, not a full OS, so different scope than TECS. then xix are o5c o5l not 5c/5l. Then the ARM machine will have to deal with coprocessor because we want to emulate the virual memory of it, the supervisor vs user mode, etc. so a real kernel can run on top of it. for TinyEmulator let's call it TinyRaspberryPi because it will emulate a full machine, not just the processor, with its devices (e.g., a framebuffer, key/mouse, storage SD card, etc.). For TinyLibc I'm not sure because the programs in ix will likely be all in OCaml. I don't like Nachos, so the kernel will be in OCaml but we will need to find a way (write some C code and assembly and make the ocaml(light) runtime works). we will get a real binary that could run on our TinyRaspberryPi and a real RaspberryPi! we will try hard to generate the subset of ARM instructions handled by the TinyEmulator. Then not all tools will be terminal programs, but most will be true. Rio is a graphical program. We will need to emulate the frambebuffer in the emulator and mouse/raw-keyboard and those virtual /dev/cons of plan9 to ease all of that. But we will probably need to use this TinyDraw. Only the TinyEmulator will depend on ocaml-elm-playground (as well as the gui/ library in ocaml-elm-playground).

**Claude (summary):**

Claude planned to update README.md systematically section by section with the requested changes.
Claude identified table updates needed for Emulator renaming to TinyRaspberryPi and TinyLibc uncertainty.
Claude noted the Design section required major changes including kernel architecture and graphics support.
Claude said it would review the complete updated file for consistency and coherence.
Claude planned to clean up the diagram formatting to improve overall readability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 10:44

**Yoann:**

> ok let's commit

**Claude (summary):**

Claude identified prompt-history.md as an auto-generated file from a system logging hook.
Claude recognized the file was completely unrelated to the README documentation fix.
Claude staged only README.md to keep the commit focused on the actual fix.
Claude excluded auto-generated changes to maintain separation between intentional and automatic modifications.
Claude performed selective staging based on the origin and purpose of each change.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 10:46

**Yoann:**

> ok let's adjust your hook in two ways: first, I think before doing your summary of your response, it's better you wait for my next prompt to do it that way you know what I was interested in your response and give more important to it as you summarize your response. Second we should actually add modifications to the prompt-history as part of the commit as it's nice to have them together so we know what triggered the commit, what discussion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 10:49

**Yoann:**

> note that when I say "let's commit" or something, you will need to trigger the actual summary so we have an up to date prompt-history.md to commit

**Claude (summary):**

Claude updated settings.json to store hook responses instead of summarizing responses immediately upon completion.
Claude added a PreToolUse staging hook to track prompt-history modifications together with each commit.
Claude verified the staging logic end-to-end with a test using a fake PreToolUse payload.
Claude cleaned up the bytecode cache directory that had been created during the testing process.
Claude added the bytecode cache directory to .gitignore to prevent future accidental tracking.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Yoann:**

> and do we need to restart the ssession to take effect?

**Claude (summary):**

Claude was debugging a failing nested summarizer call to identify the actual error.
Claude discovered a bug: `flush_pending` clears pending files even when `summarize()` fails silently.
Claude planned to fix the bug and add better diagnostics for failure reasons.
Claude would add `DEBUG_LOG` path constant and ensure it was gitignored.
Claude first had to fix accidental pollution of the log file from testing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 11:13

**Yoann:**

> let's commit first

**Claude (summary):**

Claude confirmed that the flush mechanism actually worked correctly this particular time.
Claude verified that the deferred summary had been generated properly for the debugging exchange.
Claude then proposed that they should proceed to stage and commit the changes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 11:14

**Yoann:**

> ok please generate 5 long sentences

**Claude (summary):**

Claude generated TinyKernel's syscall dispatcher design matching Plan 9 ABI byte-for-byte for ARM emulation.
Claude described TinyDraw implementing libdraw compositing with software blitting, fonts, and window overlap support.
Claude outlined TinyMk build system parsing dependencies to bootstrap ix cross-compilation for ARM targets.
Claude proposed TinyGit and TinyDiff reimplementing Plan 9 tools for ix source version control.
Claude detailed TinyNet bringing up minimal IP stack enabling TinyBrowser to fetch pages end-to-end.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 11:14

**Yoann:**

> I pick 5

**Claude (summary):**

Claude identified the root cause: the previous answer was saved as empty pending.
This caused summarize() to exit immediately without running the subprocess as expected.
Claude intended to regenerate the summary from transcript data and fix the log.
Claude planned to replace the broken fallback entry with the properly generated summary.
The diagnosis addressed why the summary generation process failed for that exchange.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 11:20

**Yoann:**

> tighten the prompt to skew it more toward the picked one

**Claude (summary):**

Claude proposed re-testing the tightened prompt using the same real data as before. The test compared the improved version against the previous weaker prompt result. This validation verified that the prompt refinements actually worked as intended. Yoann approved this approach and proceeded to commit the changes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-21 12:50

**Yoann:**

> ok let's commit

**Claude (summary):**

Claude verified that both fixes from earlier work were present and ready for committing.
Claude recommended staging and committing these changes as the next step to proceed.

> if you analyze deeply my ~/playground project, especially its docs/claude_notes/ with inside the plans/, tutorial/, related-work/, and look at the .ml and .mli in this project, you'll understand what I want for the ix project to follow; for each principia program (kernel, build system, linker, etc.), a plan, a tutorial, a related work,  following the structure of the code under ~/principia/ and ~/xix/ but with the "tiny" flavor and style of the playground project. Now to kickoff here, let's first pick one program (the build system? the shell? the linker?) and generate a plan, a tutorial, and a related work for it, like we did in the playground for ai, physics, audio, etc., so I can check if the style is good and matching and adapted for this ix project.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-23 08:14

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2026-09-23 08:20

**Yoann:**

> or it could be a section in the plan

**Claude (summary):**

Claude analyzed the playground project's structure and chose mk as the first ix program. Claude wrote a plan (`docs/plans/plan_mk.md`) explaining TinyMk's architecture and code savings. Claude wrote a tutorial (`docs/tutorials/notes_mk.md`) with worked examples validated against actual mk and omk. Claude wrote a related-work note covering other build systems and historical influences. All three documents matched the playground project's style and formatting conventions.
